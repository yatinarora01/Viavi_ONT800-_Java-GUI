# Viavi_ONT800-_Java-GUI
Developed a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) application to control and interact with the ONT-800 device using Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments (SCPI).

#**Title: ONT-800 SCPI Java Controller Application**

**Objective: Develop a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) application to control and interact with the ONT-800 device using Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments (SCPI).**

Functional Requirements:
Connectivity: The application should establish a connection to the ONT-800 device using the provided IP address and port number.
Command Execution: The application should allow users to send SCPI commands to the device and display the responses.
Error Injection: The application should have the capability to inject MAC errors and TPKT errors into the device.
Error Detection: The application should detect errors injected from the device and update the GUI status panel accordingly.
Event Logging: The application should log all user actions and device responses in an event log area.
Reporting: The application should generate reports displaying the longest, shortest, and last error durations in nanoseconds.
Non-Functional Requirements:
Usability: The GUI should be intuitive and easy to use, with clear labels and instructions.
Performance: The application should respond quickly to user inputs and handle device responses without noticeable delays.
Reliability: The application should handle errors gracefully, providing informative messages to the user.
Scalability: The application should be able to handle multiple simultaneous commands and maintain performance.
Target Audience:
Technical sales personnel who need to demonstrate the capabilities of the ONT-800 device.
Product engineers who require a tool to test and debug the ONT-800 device.
Deliverables:
The complete Java source code for the ONT-800 SCPI Java Controller application.
